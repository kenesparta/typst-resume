# Typst Resume

A clean, single-page resume built with Typst and driven by simple JSON data files. It renders to a PDF with consistent
typography and layout.

## Preview

- A recent build is included as `main.pdf` for quick preview.
- Release builds are named like `ken_esparta_cv_<hash>.pdf` (generated by the Makefile).

## Prerequisites

- [Typst Install](https://typst.app/open-source)
- Make (optional, for using the provided Makefile)
- Fonts are bundled in `fonts/` and referenced automatically during compilation.

## Quick Start

- Build a development PDF:
    - Using Make: `make gen-test`
    - Directly with Typst: `typst compile main.typ main.pdf --font-path fonts`
- Build a release PDF with a short hash in the filename:
    - `make gen-release`
- Clean generated PDFs:
    - `make clean`

The generated PDF will appear in the project root.

## Project Structure

- `main.typ` — Entry point that includes the section templates.
- `title.typ` — Name and role heading.
- `contact.typ` — Contact links and social info.
- `intro.typ` — Short professional summary.
- `experience.typ` — Work experience section, rendered from JSON.
- `projects.typ` — Selected projects, rendered from JSON.
- `education.typ` — Education history, rendered from JSON.
- `skills.typ` — Skills by category, rendered from JSON.
- `config.typ` — Theme colors, common helpers, and reusable components.
- `fonts/` — Local font files used by the layout.
- `data/` — All data sources used to populate the resume sections:
    - `experience.json`
    - `projects.json`
    - `education.json`
    - `skills.json`
- `Makefile` — Convenience tasks for building and cleaning.

## Editing Your Resume

Update the JSON files in `data/` to change content. Keys are straightforward and self-descriptive.

- experience.json
    - Fields per job: `company`, `position`, `location`, `from`, `to`, `short_description`, `description` (array of
      bullet points)
    - Dates use the format `MM-YYYY`. An empty `to` value means "Now".
- projects.json
    - Fields per project: `name`, `institution`, `link`, `link_name`, `description` (array of bullet points)
- education.json
    - Fields per entry: `school`, `location`, `degree`, `from`, `to`
- skills.json
    - Array of objects with: `category` and `items` (array of strings)

After editing, run a build command again to regenerate the PDF.

## Customization

- Colors and style helpers live in `config.typ`:
    - `primary_color`, `secondary_color`, `accent_color`
    - `format_date` function converts `MM-YYYY` strings into "Mon YYYY".
    - `section_title` and `new_contact` helpers for consistent section styling and links.
- Typography is defined in `main.typ` and the section files, using fonts from `fonts/`.
- Page size and margins are configured in `main.typ`.

## Tips

- Keep bullet points concise and outcome-focused.
- Prefer consistent verb tense and measurable results where possible.
- Rebuild after each change to verify layout fits on a single page.

## Troubleshooting

- If Typst can't find the fonts, ensure you pass the `--font-path fonts` flag (Makefile already does this).
- If dates render unexpectedly, confirm the `MM-YYYY` format (e.g., `10-2022`).
