      "Built a multi-crate system including device firmware, a BLE listener, and an Axum WebSocket server to process and display live button events.",
      "It connects an embedded micro:bit v2 (running custom firmware) via Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) to a host-side listener.",
      "The listener forwards the device's button events to an Axum-based WebSocket server, which then broadcasts the data to a web dashboard for live, real-time visualization.",
      "This project demonstrates full-stack communication from hardware to a web interface."
