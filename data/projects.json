      "Built a multi-crate system including device firmware, a BLE listener, and an Axum WebSocket server to process and display live button events.",
      "It connects an embedded micro:bit v2 (running custom firmware) via Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) to a host-side listener.",
      "The listener forwards the device's button events to an Axum-based WebSocket server, which then broadcasts the data to a web dashboard for live, real-time visualization.",
      "This project demonstrates full-stack communication from hardware to a web interface."

      "Full-Stack Rust Authentication Service: Built a robust authentication service using Axum (HTTP) and Tonic (gRPC), handling user signup, login, and secure API communication.",
      "Security & Persistence: Implemented JWT for session management with secure HttpOnly cookies, utilized Argon2 for password hashing, and used PostgreSQL with SQLx migrations for persistent user storage.",
      "Advanced Features: Included optional email-based 2FA and integrated Redis for real-time token revocation (banned tokens).",
      "Containerized Deployment: Designed for quick deployment with pre-configured Docker/Docker Compose setup, ensuring service isolation and portability."
