With 8+ years of deep experience in the IT industry, I don't just build APIs-I engineer foundational digital architecture. I specialize in designing and implementing efficient, rock-solid, and highly scalable interfaces that serve as the backbone for robust systems. My extensive background includes fortifying secure communication across complex microservice ecosystems. I am actively seeking high-impact projects that demand innovation in parallel and distributed computing.
